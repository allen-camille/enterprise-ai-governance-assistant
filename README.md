# Enterprise AI Governance Assistant (SPÅR C)

**Governance-first AI decision support for incident and risk handling in regulated environments.**

This project is a portfolio-grade implementation of **SPÅR C** – focusing on how AI assistants can be designed for **enterprise use**, with emphasis on:
- information security
- regulatory compliance
- auditability
- human-in-the-loop decision support

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The assistant is designed to support security and governance roles by:
- structuring incomplete incident information
- producing a clear, time-bound **status picture**
- separating **facts, uncertainties, and open questions**
- enabling controlled “freeze” states for decision-making

It does **not** automate decisions.  
It **supports human judgement**.

- AI governance & risk awareness  
- Incident handling logic (ISO 27001 / NIS2 aligned)
- Prompt design for regulated contexts
- Versioned status reporting
- Secure handling of secrets (env-based configuration)
- Enterprise-ready architecture thinking
